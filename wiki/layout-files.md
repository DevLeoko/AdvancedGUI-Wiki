# Layout Files

A GUI's layout and behaviour is defined in a layout file. These layout files can be create through the web editor.


To use these layouts you place them in the `plugins/AdvancedGUI/layouts/` folder to get the GUI onto your server. The name of the file is not relevant. The GUI name is defined through the web editor.


You can also use these files as backups. Though all GUI data is saved directly in your browser, it might be a good idea to use file backups in case your browser memory gets cleared.

## Examples
You can download some example layout files that are used on our showcase-server `AGShowcase.hopefuls.de` here:
