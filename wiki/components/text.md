## Description

The `Text-Component` is a very basic component which displays text. You can adjust the font family, size, alignment and color. You can even upload your own .ttf font.

## Placeholders

The text in `Text-Component` can contain placeholders from [PlaceholderAPI](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders) and some custom AdvancedGUI placeholders. To enable this you need to check the `CONTAINS PLACEHOLDERS` checkbox. You then enter the text with the placeholders in the `TEXT` input field (e.g. `Hey there %player_name%!`) and can input some example preview text in the `PREVIEW TEXT` input (e.g. `Hey there Leoko!`) to get a preview in the web editor of how the text will look ingame.
