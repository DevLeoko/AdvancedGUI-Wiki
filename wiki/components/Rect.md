## Description

The `Rect-Component` is a very basic component which displays a colored rectangle.

## Transparent

You can choose to make the rectange transparent. This can be useful to define an area where you want to add click actions. For example if you have an large image and want to perform actions based on what part of the image the user clicks on, then you can place multiple invisible `Rect-Components` at the according areas.
