## Description

The `Check-Component` is used to change your layout depending on whether a check passes or not. Is has two child components and some sort of check (e.g. a permissions-check). The first component is displayed if the check passes and the second one if not.

Click the `SHOW NEGATIVE COMPONENT` checkbox to preview the negative state in the editor.
